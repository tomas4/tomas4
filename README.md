- 👋 Hi, I’m @tomas4
- 👀 I’m interested in use of GIS, remote sensing data and scripting in satellite environment monitoring, currently especially in water quality monitoring.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on similar projects, perhaps someone could test my scripts on their data and also my water quality models - see my [ResearchGate profile](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tomas-Brunclik) for more info.
- 📫 Reach me there, or using contacts on my [Uni profile](https://fes.upce.cz/user/8884), or perhaps via [Messenger](https://m.me/tbrunclik).
